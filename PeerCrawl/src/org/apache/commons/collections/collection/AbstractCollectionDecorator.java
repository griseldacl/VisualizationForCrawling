/**
 * Decorates another <code>Collection</code> to provide additional behaviour.
 * <p>
 * Each method call made on this <code>Collection</code> is forwarded to the
 * decorated <code>Collection</code>. This class is used as a framework on which
 * to build to extensions such as synchronized and unmodifiable behaviour. The
 * main advantage of decoration is that one decorator can wrap any implementation
 * of <code>Collection</code>, whereas sub-classing requires a new class to be
 * written for each implementation.
 * <p>
 * This implementation does not perform any special processing with
 * {@link #iterator()}. Instead it simply returns the value from the 
 * wrapped collection. This may be undesirable, for example if you are trying
 * to write an unmodifiable implementation it might provide a loophole.
